# The Meta-Architecture of the IDGL

## What This Is: The Ultimate Proof

This directory contains the formal, canonical `Specs` that define the IDGL documentation system itself. It is the tangible evidence behind the claim that the "IDGL is a self-defining system."

We have applied the framework's own patterns—primarily the **Decomposition** and **Legacy Onboarding** plays—to reverse-engineer and formally document its own architecture.

## How to Read This

This is a living architectural blueprint.

1.  **Start with the Master Plan:** The best place to begin is the Epic Spec, which outlines the decomposition of the entire system.
    *   **[The Master Plan →](./00-epic-spec-decomposition.md)**

2.  **Explore the Components:** From the master plan, you can explore the detailed `Spec` for each of the six core components of the documentation system:
    *   **[Core Philosophy →](./01-spec-core-philosophy.md)**: The "Why" of IDGL.
    *   **[Pattern Library →](./02-spec-pattern-library.md)**: The catalog of "Architect's Plays."
    *   **[Agent Protocols →](./03-spec-agent-protocols.md)**: The "engine" or operational instructions for AI partners.
    *   **[User Onboarding →](./04-spec-user-onboarding.md)**: The user's entry point and learning path.
    *   **[Implementation Examples →](./05-spec-implementation-examples.md)**: The "proof" of the system's practical application.
    *   **[Presentation Suite →](./06-spec-presentation-suite.md)**: The persuasive instruments for communicating the value of IDGL.
