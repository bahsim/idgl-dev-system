# Domain-Specific Boot Config Analysis

## ü§î **Analyzing Both Solutions in Detail**

### **Paragraph 1: Argument for Generic Boot Config**
Using a generic boot config for all domains creates a unified methodology that all team members can understand and apply consistently. This approach leverages the proven IDGL foundation that already includes excellent patterns for spec compilation, decomposition, and artifact generation - all of which are applicable across different domains. The existing communication principles, agent protocols, and artifact lifecycle workflows provide a solid, battle-tested framework that teams can trust regardless of their specific domain. By using a single generic config, we maintain consistency across the entire system while allowing domain-specific implementation through the spec itself. This approach is faster to implement since we don't need to create and maintain multiple configs, and it ensures that all domains follow the same methodological rigor. The risk is minimal since we're building on what already works, and we can always refine the generic patterns based on real-world usage across multiple domains.

### **Paragraph 2: Argument for Domain-Specific Boot Config**
Creating domain-specific boot configs allows each domain to have a perfectly tailored system that addresses its unique requirements and challenges. MFU generation has specific needs that generic patterns don't address: content quality assessment, meeting type classification, output format selection, and quality validation against input data. A domain-specific config can include specialized patterns for content analysis workflows, data quality validation protocols, and documentation format selection strategies that are core to MFU rather than optional additions. This approach gives each domain exactly what it needs without unnecessary complexity, and teams can adopt the methodology that fits their specific use case without confusion about irrelevant patterns. The result is more intuitive systems that teams can use more effectively, while still maintaining the methodological rigor of the original IDGL framework.

### **Paragraph 3: Additional Considerations**
Code generation and MFU generation are fundamentally different domains - one produces executable artifacts while the other produces documentation. Teams using these systems have different needs and shouldn't be forced to navigate a Swiss Army knife approach. The risk of building a monolithic system that becomes unwieldy over time is significant when trying to accommodate all domains in a single config. Each domain benefits from having exactly what it needs without unnecessary complexity, and teams can adopt the methodology that fits their specific use case without confusion about irrelevant patterns.

## üéØ **Final Decision:**

**Domain-specific boot configs are better** because they address the fundamental differences between domains while preventing monolithic complexity. By creating focused domain-specific configs, we avoid the risk of building a monolithic system that becomes unwieldy over time. Each domain gets exactly what it needs without unnecessary complexity, and teams can adopt the methodology that fits their specific use case without confusion about irrelevant patterns.

## üìÅ **Implementation Structure:**

- **Generic Config:** `idgl-dev-system/04-ai-agent-boot-config/idgl-boot-config.yaml`
- **Domain-Specific Configs:** `idgl-dev-system/04-ai-agent-boot-config/domain-specific-configs/`
- **Analysis Documents:** `idgl-dev-system/04-ai-agent-boot-config/domain-specific-configs/[domain]-boot-config-analysis.md`

## üîÑ **Process for New Domain-Specific Configs:**

1. **Analyze domain requirements** and unique challenges
2. **Copy generic config** as starting point
3. **Remove irrelevant patterns** and protocols
4. **Add domain-specific patterns** and protocols
5. **Document reasoning** in analysis file
6. **Validate** against domain-specific use cases
