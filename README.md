# The IDGL Development System: An Introduction

Welcome to the Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL) Development System. This collection of documents defines a complete, expert-level system for developing software in partnership with artificial intelligence.

## The Core Philosophy

The IDGL system is an engineering discipline built on a single, powerful premise: **human intent**, not the generated code, must be the primary, authoritative source of truth.

This is achieved by establishing a formal, auditable relationship between a human-authored `Spec` and an AI-generated `Digital Product`. The system provides the principles, processes, and patterns for managing this relationship at scale.

## Navigating the Core Documentation

This directory contains the detailed breakdown of the IDGL system. To understand the core methodology, the documents should be read in the following order:

1.  **[The Conceptual Model](./00-the-conceptual-model.md):** Start here. This document defines the high-level philosophy and the three core pillars of the system: The Spec, The AI, and The Digital Product.

2.  **[The Generative Task](./01-the-generative-task.md):** This document specifies the formal, executable process—the Generative Task and its IDGL Cycle—for turning a Spec into a validated Digital Product.

3.  **[A Specification for Authoring Specs](./02-anatomy-of-a-spec.md):** This document provides the formal specification for authoring a high-quality, professional Spec.

## Framework & Patterns

Once you have a firm grasp of the core methodology, you can explore the optional but powerful **[IDGL Patterns](./01-patterns/)**, which provide organizational structures for managing Generative Tasks at scale.
