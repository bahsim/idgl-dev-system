# The IDGL Development System: An Introduction

Welcome to the Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL) Development System. This collection of documents defines a complete, expert-level system for developing software in partnership with artificial intelligence.

## The Core Philosophy

The IDGL system is an engineering discipline built on a single, powerful premise: **human intent**, not the generated code, must be the primary, authoritative source of truth.

This is achieved by establishing a formal, auditable relationship between a human-authored `Spec` and an AI-generated `Digital Product`. The system provides the principles, processes, and patterns for managing this relationship at scale.

## The Core Methodology

The core methodology is defined by the following three documents, which establish the expert-level standard for the system. They should be read in order:

1.  **[The Conceptual Model](./00-the-conceptual-model.md):** Defines the high-level philosophy and the core pillars of the IDGL system. (Start here)

2.  **[The Generative Task](./01-the-generative-task.md):** Specifies the formal, executable process for turning a Spec into a validated Digital Product.

3.  **[The Anatomy of a Spec](./02-anatomy-of-a-spec.md):** Defines the engineering standard for authoring a high-quality Spec.

## Framework & Patterns

Once you have a firm grasp of the core methodology, you can explore the optional but powerful **[IDGL Patterns](./01-patterns/)**, which provide organizational structures for managing Generative Tasks at scale.
