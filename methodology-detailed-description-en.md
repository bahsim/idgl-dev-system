## Core Terminology

### Foundational Concepts

**IDGL (Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle)** - A revolutionary software development approach that leverages strategic human-AI collaboration, focusing on outcome-driven intentions rather than traditional task-based workflows.

**Intent** - A precise, measurable declaration of desired outcomes that articulates what needs to be accomplished, not what needs to be built. Structured as: "Build [capability] that delivers [specific outcome] for [user segment]".

**Generative Cycle** - A continuous iteration loop comprising three core phases: intent definition, AI-powered solution generation, and human validation with refinement.

**AI-Native Workflow** - A development methodology purpose-built for human-AI collaboration, rather than retrofitting existing processes.

### Team Roles

**Strategic Lead** - The human counterpart responsible for crafting intentions, providing strategic guidance, and validating AI-generated outputs. Typically a Product Manager, Technical Lead, or Senior Engineer.

**AI Co-Pilot** - The AI system acting as a generative engine and intelligent assistant for solution creation based on human-defined intentions.

**Quality Assurance Team** - Development professionals focused on validating AI outputs, ensuring compliance with requirements, and refining generated solutions.

### Development Phases

**Intent Definition Phase** - The strategic planning stage where clear, measurable objectives are established.

**AI Generation Phase** - The collaborative creation stage where AI produces complete, functional solutions based on human intentions.

**Validation & Enhancement Phase** - The quality assurance stage where human teams verify AI outputs and iteratively improve them.

### Deliverables

**Intent Specification** - A comprehensive document outlining the intention, success metrics, constraints, and business context.

**Solution Architecture** - An AI-generated technical blueprint that translates intentions into implementable solutions.

**Quality Assurance Framework** - A systematic approach for validating AI-generated solutions against business and technical requirements.

## Methodology Framework

### IDGL Principles

1. **Outcome-Driven Intentions**
   - Every development effort centers on clear, measurable outcomes
   - Intentions focus on business value, not technical tasks
   - Each intention includes specific success metrics and constraints

2. **AI-Powered Generation**
   - AI serves as an intelligent co-creator, not a simple automation tool
   - Generation leverages strategic context and business understanding
   - Solutions emerge as complete, integrated systems rather than isolated components

3. **Human-Centric Validation**
   - All AI-generated solutions undergo rigorous human review
   - Validation encompasses quality, compliance, performance, and business alignment
   - Human insights drive continuous refinement and improvement

4. **Rapid Iteration Cycles**
   - Development follows accelerated, focused iteration loops
   - Each cycle delivers demonstrable, functional value
   - Iterations continue until business objectives are fully met
