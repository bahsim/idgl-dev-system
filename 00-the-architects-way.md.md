# IDGL: From Chaos to Control

Generative AI has introduced a new tension into our work: the incredible **speed** of AI versus the professional **discipline** required to build robust software. This chaos forces a choice upon every engineer:

Are we **Gamblers**, who hope for a lucky prompt and spend our days cleaning up the mess?

Or are we **Architects**, who command AI with a clear plan to guarantee the result?

This repository contains the **Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL)**: the definitive playbook for becoming an Architect in the AI era. It is a lightweight, tool-agnostic discipline for turning the chaos of generative AI into predictable, controllable outcomes by shifting our focus from the **labor** of writing code to the **leverage** of perfecting intent.

## The Ultimate Proof: A Self-Defining System

The ultimate proof of the Architect's discipline? **When it is robust enough to forge itself.**

This entire IDGL framework is the product of its own process. A system that can bootstrap its own creation is not a theory; it's a **proven reality.**

**[You can explore the `Specs` that define this system here →](./00-meta-specs/)**
