# IDGL in Action: The Proof

This directory contains the proof.

The core documentation defines the "why" and the "how" of the IDGL. The patterns provide the Architect's advanced plays. This directory provides the tangible, hands-on examples that prove the system works in the real world.

## Your First Step: The Vanguard Project Tutorial

The best way to learn the IDGL is to run your first project. We have a complete, hands-on tutorial that is the definitive starting point for your journey. It is designed to be your **Vanguard Project**.

You will start with a simple idea and use the core IDGL workflows to produce a fully-specified, AI-generated, and human-validated software component.

## Case Studies: The Architect's Plays in Action

These additional projects are concrete case studies that demonstrate how an Architect runs specific, advanced plays from the playbook to solve complex, real-world problems.

### 1. The React Refactor Project
*   **Focus:** A small, focused project that demonstrates how to refactor an existing component with AI assistance.
*   **Plays Demonstrated:**
    *   **[The Spec Compilation Play](../01-patterns/01-Pattern-Spec-Compilation.md):** Shows how to use an AI to compile a high-level `Brief` into a formal `Spec` with a "Tests by Default" requirement.
    *   **[The Managed Refactoring Play](../01-patterns/05-Pattern-Managed-Refactoring.md):** Provides a clear example of a "Shallow Refactoring" task.
*   **[Explore this Project →](./01-react-refactor-with-tests/)**

### 2. The NestJS Backend Sample
*   **Focus:** A larger project that demonstrates how to generate a complete, multi-layered backend application from a series of interdependent `Spec`s.
*   **Plays Demonstrated:**
    *   **[The Decomposition Play](../01-patterns/03-Pattern-Decomposition.md):** Shows how to break down a large goal ("build a backend") into a sequence of smaller, verifiable tasks.
    *   **[The Development Phase Play](../01-patterns/08-Pattern-Lifecycle-Phases.md):** Provides a real-world example of a multi-task development phase.
*   **[Explore this Project →](./03-nestjs-sample/)**
