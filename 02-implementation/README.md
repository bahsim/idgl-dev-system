# IDGL in Action: The Proof

This directory contains the proof.

The core documentation defines the "why" and the "how" of the IDGL. The patterns provide the Architect's advanced plays. This directory provides the tangible, hands-on examples that prove the system works in the real world.

## Your First Step: The Vanguard Project Tutorial

The best way to learn the IDGL is to run your first project. We have a complete, hands-on tutorial that is the definitive starting point for your journey. It is designed to be your **Vanguard Project**.

You will start with a simple idea and use the core IDGL workflows to produce a fully-specified, AI-generated, and human-validated software component.

## Case Studies: The Architect's Plays in Action

These projects are concrete case studies that demonstrate how an Architect runs specific, advanced plays from the playbook to solve complex, real-world problems.

### 1. The React Refactor Project
*   **Focus:** A small, focused project that demonstrates how to refactor an existing component with AI assistance.
*   **Plays Demonstrated:**
    *   **[The Spec Compilation Play](../01-patterns/01-Pattern-Spec-Compilation.md):** Shows how to use an AI to compile a high-level `Brief` into a formal `Spec` with a "Tests by Default" requirement.
    *   **[The Managed Refactoring Play](../01-patterns/05-Pattern-Managed-Refactoring.md):** Provides a clear example of a "Shallow Refactoring" task.
*   **[Explore this Project ‚Üí](./01-react-refactor-with-tests/)**

### 2. The NestJS Backend Sample
*   **Focus:** A larger project that demonstrates how to generate a complete, multi-layered backend application from a series of interdependent `Spec`s.
*   **Plays Demonstrated:**
    *   **[The Decomposition Play](../01-patterns/03-Pattern-Decomposition.md):** Shows how to break down a large goal ("build a backend") into a sequence of smaller, verifiable tasks.
    *   **[The Development Phase Play](../01-patterns/08-Pattern-Lifecycle-Phases.md):** Provides a real-world example of a multi-task development phase.
*   **[Explore this Project ‚Üí](./03-nestjs-sample/)**

### 3. The React Project Scanner ‚≠ê **NEW**
*   **Focus:** A production-ready tool that demonstrates enterprise-scale IDGL implementation, analyzing React TypeScript projects with semantic understanding.
*   **Plays Demonstrated:**
    *   **[The Decomposition Play](../01-patterns/03-Pattern-Decomposition.md):** Shows how to break complex tooling into focused, manageable components.
    *   **[The Legacy Onboarding Play](../01-patterns/04-Pattern-Legacy-Onboarding.md):** Demonstrates bringing existing code under IDGL control.
    *   **[The Refinement Loop](../01-patterns/02-Pattern-Refinement-Loop.md):** Shows iterative improvement from initial concept to production-ready tool.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **üîç AST Parser**: Analyzes React TypeScript patterns with semantic understanding
    *   **üìä Dependency Graph**: Maps project relationships and submodule structures
    *   **üèóÔ∏è Built with IDGL**: Every component follows the `Spec` ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Refine loop
    *   **‚úÖ Production Ready**: Handles enterprise-scale projects with 10,000+ files
*   **[Explore this Project ‚Üí](./04-react-project-scanner/)**

## What These Projects Prove

Each project demonstrates a different aspect of the IDGL's power:

*   **The Tutorial** proves that anyone can learn and apply the system.
*   **The Refactor Project** proves that the system works for small, focused improvements.
*   **The NestJS Sample** proves that the system scales to complex, multi-component applications.
*   **The React Scanner** proves that the system can build production tools that would be impossible with traditional development approaches.

Together, they form a complete proof that the IDGL is not just theory‚Äîit's a practical methodology that transforms how we build software in the AI era.
