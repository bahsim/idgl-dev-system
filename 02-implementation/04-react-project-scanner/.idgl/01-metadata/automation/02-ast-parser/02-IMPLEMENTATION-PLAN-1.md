- [x] Maintain clean project separation

## **Phase 4: Enhanced Type System Integration (Critical for React)**
**Objective**: Handle complex TypeScript types and improve type resolution accuracy

### **Step 4.1: Babel TypeScript Enhancement**
- [ ] Configure `@babel/preset-typescript` for better type annotation parsing
- [ ] Implement proper generic type extraction (e.g., `T extends object`)
- [ ] Handle union types (`'primary' | 'secondary'`) and intersection types (`BaseProps & Theme`)
- [ ] Extract conditional types and type guards

### **Step 4.2: Cross-File Type Resolution**
- [ ] Track import/export chains for type resolution
- [ ] Resolve types from `import { UserProps } from './types'`
- [ ] Handle re-exports and namespace imports
- [ ] Build type dependency graph for accurate resolution

## **Phase 5: Advanced React Pattern Detection**
**Objective**: Detect sophisticated React patterns and component architectures

### **Step 5.1: Advanced Component Patterns**
- [ ] Detect `forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, Props>` patterns with proper type extraction
- [ ] Handle `React.memo` components with custom comparison functions
- [ ] Identify higher-order components (`withHOC(Component)`)
- [ ] Support compound components (`Compound.Item`)

### **Step 5.2: Enhanced Hook Detection**
- [ ] Detect hooks with complex return types and generics
- [ ] Handle conditional hook usage patterns
- [ ] Support context providers and consumers
- [ ] Identify render props and children-as-function patterns

## **Phase 6: Pattern Intelligence & Analysis**
**Objective**: Provide deeper insights into code patterns and relationships

### **Step 6.1: Semantic Analysis**
- [ ] Classify patterns by purpose (UI, Logic, Data, Utility)
- [ ] Calculate cyclomatic complexity for functions
- [ ] Assess reusability and coupling metrics
- [ ] Generate pattern relationship graphs

### **Step 6.2: Dependency & Usage Analysis**
- [ ] Track which patterns import/use which other patterns
- [ ] Map cross-project pattern dependencies
- [ ] Identify shared/common patterns across projects
- [ ] Generate dependency impact analysis

## **Phase 7: Advanced TypeScript Features**
**Objective**: Support modern TypeScript language features

### **Step 7.1: Modern TypeScript Support**
- [ ] Handle template literal types (`` `Hello ${Name}` ``)
- [ ] Support mapped types and conditional types
- [ ] Extract complex generic constraints and bounds
- [ ] Parse type assertions and type predicates

### **Step 7.2: Type Inference Enhancement**
- [ ] Improve type inference from usage patterns
- [ ] Handle type narrowing and control flow analysis
- [ ] Support type parameter inference in generics
- [ ] Extract inferred types from complex expressions

## **Implementation Notes**

### **Critical Dependencies**
- `@babel/parser` for AST parsing with TypeScript/JSX support
- `@babel/traverse` for AST traversal and pattern detection
- `@babel/types` for type checking and node identification
- `fs` and `path` for file system operations
- `crypto` for hash generation
- `worker_threads` for parallel processing

### **Key Design Decisions**
- **Incremental Approach**: Each phase builds on the previous
- **Performance First**: Optimize early to avoid refactoring later
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's own type system
- **Extensibility**: Design for plugins from the beginning

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Complex Type Resolution**: Start with simple types, add complexity gradually
- **Performance**: Benchmark early and often
- **Memory Usage**: Implement streaming and garbage collection from Phase 1
- **Accuracy**: Build comprehensive test suite with real React codebases

This plan focuses on the essential steps needed to build a production-grade AST parser while maintaining the IDGL principle of "YAGNI" - only implementing what's truly necessary for each phase.
