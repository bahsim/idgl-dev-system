# Case Study: The End-to-End Tutorial

## 1. Objective
To codify the mature principles of the IDGL into a canonical, step-by-step tutorial that serves as the primary onboarding path for any developer new to the Architect's workflow. The goal was **education and clarification**, not architectural discovery.

## 2. Architect's Plays Demonstrated
This project serves as the primary, hands-on teaching tool for the core IDGL workflow, centered on two key plays:

*   **[The Spec Compilation Play](../../01-patterns/01-Pattern-Spec-Compilation.md):** The tutorial provides a crystal-clear, step-by-step demonstration of this foundational play.
*   **[The Vanguard Project Play](../../01-patterns/11-Pattern-Strategic-Adoption.md):** This tutorial is explicitly designed to be a new user's first **Vanguard Project**.

## 3. The Process (A Learning Architecture)
The project's design was pedagogical. The sophisticated IDGL workflow was deconstructed into a series of simple, digestible steps to create a linear, self-paced learning experience.

The final architecture is a six-part tutorial that guides the user from a high-level scenario definition to a final, validated artifact and a retrospective that connects the practical exercise back to the core philosophy.

## 4. Outcome
The project was a success. It produced a clear, effective, and accessible onboarding experience that translates the powerful but abstract concepts of the IDGL into a tangible, practical workflow. It is the essential "first-day" experience for any new Architect, empowering them to understand and adopt the methodology quickly.
