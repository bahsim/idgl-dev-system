# IDGL Workflow Example

This directory contains the core artifacts for an Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL) task.

## The Artifacts

1.  **`01-human-brief.md`**: The starting point. This is a short, high-level request authored by a human developer that defines the goal of the generative task.

2.  **`01b-prompt-to-gen-spec.md`**: The full prompt. This is a complete, context-rich prompt that is given to an AI "Spec Compiler." It is generated by a tool (`assemble-spec-prompt.ps1`) that combines the human brief with the full source code of any relevant files.

3.  **`02b-generated-spec.md`**: The final `Spec`. This is the output from the AI "Spec Compiler." It is a formal, detailed, and verifiable engineering document that an AI "Worker" can execute to perform the code modifications.

## The Workflow

1.  A developer writes or updates the `01-human-brief.md` to reflect a new goal.
2.  The developer runs the `assemble-spec-prompt.ps1` script, which generates the content for `01b-prompt-to-gen-spec.md`.
3.  The developer provides the content of `01b-prompt-to-gen-spec.md` to an AI agent.
4.  The developer saves the AI's response as `02b-generated-spec.md`.
5.  Finally, the `02b-generated-spec.md` is executed by an AI "Worker" (or a human) to produce the final code artifacts.
