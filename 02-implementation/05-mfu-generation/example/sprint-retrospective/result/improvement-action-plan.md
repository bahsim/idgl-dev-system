## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

### **1. Scope Management**
**Issue:** Scope creep on user dashboard feature (8 ‚Üí 13 points)  
**Root Cause:** Adding "nice-to-have" features during development  
**Impact:** Delayed delivery and increased complexity  

### **2. Documentation Gaps**
**Issue:** Outdated component library documentation  
**Root Cause:** Documentation not updated with new components  
**Impact:** Development time wasted figuring out existing components  

### **3. Performance Testing**
**Issue:** Database migration performance issues in staging  
**Root Cause:** Insufficient performance testing with realistic data volumes  
**Impact:** Deployment delays and production risks  

### **4. Test Coverage**
**Issue:** Test coverage at 65% (target: 80%)  
**Root Cause:** Insufficient automated testing for critical user flows  
**Impact:** Reliance on manual testing, potential for missed bugs  

### **5. Monitoring Alerts**
**Issue:** Too many false positive alerts  
**Root Cause:** Alert thresholds not properly tuned  
**Impact:** Team ignoring alerts, potential for missing real issues
