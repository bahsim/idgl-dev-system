# Sprint Planning - MFU Generation Insights

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings from Sprint Planning Example

### **Content-Driven Approach Success:**

#### **1. Meeting Type Recognition**
- **Identified:** Sprint planning meeting with clear structure
- **Pattern:** Backlog review â†’ Estimation â†’ Assignment â†’ Goal setting â†’ Risk identification
- **Benefit:** Appropriate output format selected automatically

#### **2. Data Extraction Quality**
- **Story Points:** All estimates captured with precision (29, 13, 3, 5, 8, 5, 3, 5, etc.)
- **Assignments:** Clear ownership mapping (Alex, Jen, Tom, Lisa)
- **Decisions:** Sprint goal and commitment clearly documented
- **Dependencies:** All blockers and requirements identified

#### **3. Output Structure Effectiveness**
- **Sprint Backlog:** Organized by feature with detailed breakdown
- **Team Assignments:** Clear matrix showing who does what
- **Risk Register:** Structured approach to dependency management
- **Metrics:** Velocity and capacity clearly documented

## ðŸ”§ MFU Generation Patterns for Sprint Planning

### **Input Analysis Patterns:**
1. **Backlog Item Identification** - Extract user stories and features
2. **Estimation Capture** - Story points and time estimates
3. **Assignment Mapping** - Who is responsible for what
4. **Decision Documentation** - Sprint goals and commitments
5. **Risk Assessment** - Dependencies and potential blockers

### **Output Generation Patterns:**
1. **Sprint Backlog Structure** - Feature â†’ Task â†’ Assignment â†’ Estimate
2. **Team Capacity Matrix** - Individual and team velocity
3. **Dependency Tracking** - Clear identification of blockers
4. **Risk Mitigation** - Contingency plans and alternatives
5. **Definition of Done** - Clear completion criteria

### **Quality Validation Patterns:**
1. **Completeness Check** - All discussed items captured
2. **Accuracy Verification** - Estimates and assignments match input
3. **Usability Test** - Output ready for immediate team use
4. **Consistency Check** - Format follows agile best practices

## ðŸ“Š Sprint Planning Specific Insights

### **What Works Well:**
- **Structured Estimation** - Story points provide clear effort indicators
- **Clear Ownership** - Assigned tasks with specific team members
- **Goal Definition** - Measurable sprint objectives
- **Risk Identification** - Proactive dependency management

### **Common Challenges:**
- **Over-commitment** - Team initially committed 106 points, adjusted to 50
- **Dependency Management** - External dependencies can block progress
- **Scope Creep** - Need to defer non-critical items
- **Capacity Planning** - Realistic velocity assessment

### **Best Practices Identified:**
1. **Start with Backlog Review** - Clear understanding of available work
2. **Estimate Before Assigning** - Avoid bias in effort estimation
3. **Check Team Capacity** - Ensure realistic commitments
4. **Identify Dependencies Early** - Plan for potential blockers
5. **Define Clear Sprint Goal** - Team alignment and focus

## ðŸš€ Application to Other Meeting Types

### **Planning Meetings:**
- **Product Roadmap Planning** - Feature prioritization and timeline
- **Release Planning** - Version scope and delivery planning
- **Project Planning** - Milestone and deliverable planning

### **Strategy Meetings:**
- **Quarterly Planning** - Strategic objectives and initiatives
- **Team Planning** - Capacity and capability planning
- **Resource Planning** - Budget and team allocation
