Sprint Planning Meeting - Team Alpha
Date: 2024-01-15
Duration: 2 hours
Participants: Sarah (Scrum Master), Mike (Product Owner), Alex (Frontend), Jen (Backend), Tom (DevOps), Lisa (QA)

Sarah: Welcome everyone to Sprint 24 planning. We have 2 hours to plan our next sprint. Mike, can you walk us through the product backlog items?

Mike: Sure. We have 5 high-priority items for this sprint. First is the user authentication feature - we need to implement OAuth2 with Google and GitHub. This is critical for the beta launch.

Alex: I can take the frontend part of that. We'll need to create login/logout components and integrate with the auth service. I estimate 8 story points.

Jen: I'll handle the backend authentication service. We need to set up JWT tokens and integrate with OAuth providers. That's probably 13 points for me.

Tom: I'll need to configure the OAuth apps in our environments. That's about 3 points.

Lisa: I'll need to test the authentication flows, including error cases. That's 5 points.

Sarah: Good. Next item?

Mike: Second priority is the payment integration. We need to integrate with Stripe for subscription management.

Jen: I'll handle the Stripe API integration and webhook processing. That's 8 points.

Alex: I'll create the payment UI components and subscription management interface. 5 points.

Tom: I need to set up Stripe webhook endpoints and SSL certificates. 3 points.

Lisa: Payment testing will be critical. I'll need to test various payment scenarios. 5 points.

Mike: Third item is the dashboard analytics. Users need to see their usage statistics.

Alex: I'll create the dashboard UI with charts and metrics. 8 points.

Jen: I'll build the analytics API endpoints and data aggregation. 10 points.

Lisa: I'll test the dashboard functionality and data accuracy. 4 points.

Mike: Fourth is the email notification system.

Jen: I'll integrate with SendGrid and create email templates. 5 points.

Alex: I'll create the notification preferences UI. 3 points.

Lisa: I'll test email delivery and template rendering. 3 points.

Mike: Last item is performance optimization for the main application.

Tom: I'll work on database query optimization and caching. 8 points.

Alex: I'll optimize frontend bundle size and implement lazy loading. 5 points.

Jen: I'll optimize API response times and add pagination. 6 points.

Lisa: I'll test performance improvements and load testing. 4 points.

Sarah: Let's total up the story points. Alex has 29, Jen has 42, Tom has 14, Lisa has 21. That's 106 total points.

Mike: Our team velocity has been around 80-90 points per sprint. This might be too much.

Sarah: You're right. Let's prioritize. Which items are must-have for the beta launch?

Mike: Authentication and payment integration are critical. Dashboard and email notifications can wait. Performance optimization is nice-to-have.

Sarah: So we'll commit to authentication (29 points) and payment integration (21 points). That's 50 points total, which is more realistic.

Alex: I agree. We can focus on those two features and do them well.

Jen: Sounds good. I'll start with the authentication backend first, then move to payment integration.

Tom: I'll set up the OAuth configuration and Stripe webhooks in parallel.

Lisa: I'll test authentication first, then payment flows.

Sarah: Great. Let's define our sprint goal: "Implement secure user authentication and payment processing to enable beta launch."

Mike: Perfect. Any risks or blockers we should discuss?

Alex: We might need design assets for the login UI. I'll need those early in the sprint.

Jen: I need the OAuth app credentials from Tom before I can start integration.

Tom: I'll get those set up by day 2 of the sprint.

Lisa: I'll need test data and test accounts for both OAuth providers.

Sarah: Good points. Let's add those as dependencies. Any other concerns?

Jen: What if the Stripe integration takes longer than expected?

Mike: We can start with a simpler payment flow and enhance it later if needed.

Sarah: Good contingency plan. Let's wrap up. Sprint 24 goal: "Implement secure user authentication and payment processing to enable beta launch." We're committing to 50 story points. Sprint starts tomorrow, ends in 2 weeks.

Mike: Sounds good. I'll update the product backlog and create the sprint backlog.

Sarah: Perfect. Thanks everyone. Let's have a great sprint!
