# Architecture Review Meeting - Context & Notes

## üìã Meeting Overview

**Project:** E-commerce Platform Development  
**Meeting Type:** Architecture Review  
**Date:** January 20, 2024  
**Duration:** 1.5 hours  

## üéØ Meeting Purpose

This architecture review meeting focused on making critical technical decisions for a new e-commerce platform. The team needed to:

1. **Choose database architecture** - Evaluate PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and hybrid approaches
2. **Select API strategy** - Compare REST vs GraphQL for frontend performance
3. **Determine system architecture** - Monolith vs microservices decision
4. **Plan deployment strategy** - Infrastructure and CI/CD approach
5. **Set implementation timeline** - Development phases and milestones

## üë• Participants

- **David** (Tech Lead) - Facilitated the meeting and made final decisions
- **Maria** (Senior Backend) - Database and API architecture expertise
- **Carlos** (Senior Frontend) - Frontend performance and user experience focus
- **Anna** (DevOps) - Infrastructure and deployment considerations
- **Sam** (Product Manager) - Business requirements and timeline constraints

## üìä Key Decisions Made

1. **Database Architecture:** Hybrid approach - PostgreSQL for orders/inventory, MongoDB for product catalog
2. **API Strategy:** REST for MVP, evaluate GraphQL for v2
3. **System Architecture:** Monolith with clear module boundaries
4. **Deployment:** Docker containers on Kubernetes
5. **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with automated testing
6. **Timeline:** 8 weeks for MVP (1 week DB setup, 4 weeks API, 3 weeks frontend)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Considerations

### **Database Decision Factors:**
- **PostgreSQL:** ACID compliance, strong consistency, complex queries
- **MongoDB:** Flexibility, performance for read-heavy operations
- **Hybrid:** Best of both worlds, manageable complexity

### **API Decision Factors:**
- **REST:** Simpler implementation, standard caching, faster development
- **GraphQL:** Better frontend performance, flexible queries, learning curve
- **Compromise:** Start with REST, migrate to GraphQL later

### **Architecture Decision Factors:**
- **Monolith:** Simpler development, easier deployment, clear module boundaries
- **Microservices:** Operational complexity, not needed at current scale
- **Future:** Can break down monolith when traffic increases

## üéØ Success Criteria

- Clear technical decisions documented
- Implementation timeline established
- Team responsibilities assigned
- Infrastructure requirements defined
- Third-party integration strategy planned
