# Technical Decision Record - E-commerce Platform Architecture

**Project:** E-commerce Platform Development  
**Date:** January 20, 2024  
**Meeting:** Architecture Review  
**Participants:** David (Tech Lead), Maria (Backend), Carlos (Frontend), Anna (DevOps), Sam (Product Manager)  

## üéØ Executive Summary

This document records the technical decisions made during the architecture review for the new e-commerce platform. The decisions focus on scalability, performance, and maintainability while balancing development velocity and operational complexity.

## üìã Technical Decisions

### 1. Database Architecture

**Decision:** Hybrid Database Approach  
**Selected:** PostgreSQL + MongoDB combination  
**Timeline:** Week 1 of development  

#### **Rationale:**
- **PostgreSQL:** Orders, inventory, and user data requiring ACID compliance and strong consistency
- **MongoDB:** Product catalog requiring flexibility and read-heavy performance optimization
- **Complexity:** Manageable with clear data ownership boundaries

#### **Alternatives Considered:**
- **PostgreSQL Only:** Strong consistency but limited flexibility for product catalog
- **MongoDB Only:** Flexibility but weaker consistency for critical business data

#### **Implementation Details:**
- PostgreSQL for: Orders, inventory, user accounts, payment data
- MongoDB for: Product catalog, product reviews, search indexes
- Data synchronization strategy to be defined
- Backup and recovery procedures for both databases

### 2. API Architecture

**Decision:** REST API for MVP, GraphQL evaluation for v2  
**Selected:** REST-first approach  
**Timeline:** MVP development (8 weeks)  

#### **Rationale:**
- **Development Velocity:** Faster implementation and debugging
- **Team Expertise:** Existing REST knowledge, reduced learning curve
- **Caching:** Standard CDN caching strategies
- **Future Flexibility:** Can migrate to GraphQL when performance demands increase

#### **Alternatives Considered:**
- **GraphQL:** Better frontend performance but adds 2 weeks to development timeline
- **Hybrid:** REST for critical operations, GraphQL for product catalog

#### **Implementation Details:**
- RESTful API design with standard HTTP methods
- JSON response format
- API versioning strategy
- GraphQL evaluation planned for v2 based on performance metrics

### 3. System Architecture

**Decision:** Monolith with Clear Module Boundaries  
**Selected:** Single application with modular design  
**Timeline:** MVP development  

#### **Rationale:**
- **Simplicity:** Easier development, deployment, and debugging
- **Team Structure:** Supports separate frontend/backend teams with clear interfaces
- **Operational Complexity:** Reduced infrastructure management overhead
- **Future Scalability:** Can break down into microservices when traffic increases

#### **Alternatives Considered:**
- **Microservices:** Better scalability but adds operational complexity
- **Event-Driven:** More complex but better for future integrations

#### **Implementation Details:**
- Clear module boundaries between frontend, API, and business logic
- Shared database connections and configuration
- Single deployment unit
- Monitoring and logging centralized

### 4. Deployment Strategy

**Decision:** Docker Containers on Kubernetes  
**Selected:** Containerized deployment with orchestration  
**Timeline:** Week 1 infrastructure setup  

#### **Rationale:**
- **Scalability:** Easy horizontal scaling and load balancing
- **Consistency:** Same environment across development, staging, and production
- **Future Flexibility:** Easy migration to microservices architecture
- **Operational Efficiency:** Automated deployment and rollback capabilities

#### **Implementation Details:**
- Docker containers for application components
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- Multi-environment deployment (dev, staging, production)
- Automated health checks and monitoring

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline

**Decision:** GitHub Actions with Automated Testing  
**Selected:** Cloud-native CI/CD solution  
**Timeline:** Week 1 setup  

#### **Rationale:**
- **Integration:** Native GitHub integration for code management
- **Automation:** Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Cost:** No additional infrastructure costs
- **Team Familiarity:** Existing GitHub workflow knowledge

#### **Implementation Details:**
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Build and deploy to staging on merge to main
- Production deployment with manual approval
- Database migration automation with Flyway
