Architecture Review Meeting - E-commerce Platform
Date: 2024-01-20
Duration: 1.5 hours
Participants: David (Tech Lead), Maria (Senior Backend), Carlos (Senior Frontend), Anna (DevOps), Sam (Product Manager)

David: Welcome everyone to our architecture review for the new e-commerce platform. We need to make some critical decisions about our tech stack and system design. Let's start with the database choice.

Maria: I've been researching our options. We have three main contenders: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and a hybrid approach. Let me break down the pros and cons.

For PostgreSQL, we get ACID compliance, strong consistency, and excellent support for complex queries. It's perfect for our order management and inventory tracking. But it's less flexible for product catalog changes.

Carlos: I'm concerned about the frontend performance. With PostgreSQL, we'll need to build a separate API layer, which adds latency. MongoDB would give us more flexibility for the product catalog and better performance for read-heavy operations.

Anna: From an infrastructure perspective, PostgreSQL is easier to manage. We have existing expertise, and it's more mature for our use case. MongoDB would require new tooling and monitoring.

David: What about the hybrid approach?

Maria: We could use PostgreSQL for orders, inventory, and user data - things that need strong consistency. Then MongoDB for the product catalog where we need flexibility and performance.

Sam: That sounds complex. What's the maintenance overhead?

Anna: It's manageable. We'd have two databases to monitor, but each serves its specific purpose. The complexity is worth it for the performance gains.

David: Let's vote. Who prefers PostgreSQL only? [Maria, Anna raise hands] MongoDB only? [Carlos raises hand] Hybrid approach? [David raises hand]

Sam: I'm leaning toward hybrid. It gives us the best of both worlds.

David: Hybrid it is. Next topic: API architecture. REST vs GraphQL?

Carlos: GraphQL would be perfect for our frontend. We can fetch exactly what we need in one request, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. It's especially valuable for the product catalog.

Maria: But GraphQL adds complexity to the backend. We need to implement resolvers and handle N+1 query problems. REST is simpler and more predictable.

Anna: GraphQL also makes caching more complex. With REST, we can use standard CDN caching strategies.

David: What about the learning curve for the team?

Carlos: Most of our frontend developers already know GraphQL. The backend team would need some training, but it's worth it for the performance benefits.

Maria: I'm concerned about the development velocity. REST is faster to implement and debug.

Sam: What's the timeline impact?

David: GraphQL would add about 2 weeks to our initial development, but save us time in the long run with better frontend performance.

Carlos: And we can always start with REST and migrate to GraphQL later.

David: Good point. Let's start with REST for MVP, then evaluate GraphQL for v2. Next: microservices vs monolith?

Maria: For our scale, a monolith would be simpler to develop and deploy. We can always break it down later when we have more traffic.

Anna: I agree. Microservices add operational complexity we don't need yet. Let's start simple.

Carlos: What about team structure? We have separate frontend and backend teams.

David: We can still have a monolith with clear module boundaries. The frontend team can work on the API layer and frontend, backend team on business logic.

Sam: That sounds reasonable. What about deployment strategy?

Anna: I recommend containerization with Docker and Kubernetes from day one. It gives us flexibility to scale and migrate to microservices later.

David: Good. Let's use Docker containers deployed to Kubernetes. What about the CI/CD pipeline?

Anna: GitHub Actions for CI/CD, automated testing, and deployment to staging/production environments.

Maria: What about database migrations?

Anna: We'll use Flyway for PostgreSQL migrations and MongoDB migration scripts. Automated backup and restore procedures.

David: Perfect. Let's summarize our decisions:

1. Database: Hybrid approach - PostgreSQL for orders/inventory, MongoDB for product catalog
2. API: REST for MVP, evaluate GraphQL for v2
3. Architecture: Monolith with clear module boundaries
4. Deployment: Docker containers on Kubernetes
5. CI/CD: GitHub Actions with automated testing

Sam: What's the implementation timeline?

David: We can start development next week. The hybrid database setup will take about 1 week, then 4 weeks for the core API, and 3 weeks for the frontend. Total: 8 weeks for MVP.

Maria: I'll create the database schemas and API specifications.

Carlos: I'll start on the frontend architecture and component library.

Anna: I'll set up the infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline.

David: Great. Let's meet again in 2 weeks to review progress. Any questions?

Sam: What about third-party integrations? Payment processing, shipping, etc.?

David: We'll use Stripe for payments, integrate with major shipping carriers, and build a plugin architecture for future integrations.

Maria: I'll research the specific APIs we need and create integration specifications.

David: Perfect. Meeting adjourned. Thanks everyone.
