# Planning: IDGL Implementation Roadmap

## 1. Context

Following the successful implementation of the `01-react-refactor-with-tests` example, this document outlines a roadmap of subsequent projects. Each project is designed to test and provide a reference implementation for one or more of the advanced, macro-level patterns in the IDGL system.

---

## 2. Example 2: The Multi-Artifact Feature

*   **Proposed Name:** `02-api-endpoint-creation`
*   **Objective:** To build a complete, new REST API endpoint in a backend framework (e.g., NestJS).
*   **Patterns to be Tested:**
    *   **Task Orchestration (Primary):** Defining and executing a sequence of dependent generative tasks (e.g., Entity -> Service -> Controller).
    *   **Composite Specs (Primary):** Using a high-level "meta-Spec" to orchestrate the granular `Specs` for each artifact.
    *   **The Generation Record (Secondary):** Creating an auditable trail for each step in the orchestrated workflow.
*   **Value:** Tests the system's ability to manage multi-artifact, greenfield feature development.

## 3. Example 3: The Legacy Onboarding

*   **Proposed Name:** `03-legacy-code-onboarding`
*   **Objective:** To take a complex, non-IDGL file and bring it under the management of the IDGL system.
*   **Patterns to be Tested:**
    *   **Legacy Onboarding (Primary):** Using an AI to analyze legacy code and reverse-engineer a formal `Spec` from it.
    *   **Managed Refactoring (Secondary):** Using the newly generated `Spec` as a contract to guide a subsequent, safe refactoring task.
*   **Value:** Tests the system's utility for managing technical debt and integrating with existing codebases.

---

## 4. Example 4: Project Scaffolding & Lifecycle

*   **Proposed Name:** `04-project-scaffolding-and-lifecycle`
*   **Objective:** To use the IDGL system to define and generate the initial structure for a new project.
*   **Patterns to be Tested:**
    *   **Standard Directory Structure (Primary):** Creating a `Spec` that formally defines a project layout, which is then generated by a "Worker AI".
    *   **Lifecycle Phases (Primary):** Organizing the `.idgl` directory into sub-directories that represent the phases of development (e.g., `01-design`, `02-implementation`).
    *   **Reusable Spec Templates (Secondary):** Creating a library of boilerplate `Spec` templates for common tasks.
*   **Value:** Tests the system's applicability to high-level architectural and organizational tasks beyond simple code generation.
