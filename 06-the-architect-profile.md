# The Architect: A Profile

## Definition

An **Architect** establishes and enforces contracts between human intent and artificial intelligence through the Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle. Unlike traditional roles that interact with AI as an assistant, the Architect maintains the **Spec** as a binding contract that AI must fulfill.

## The Architect's Three Core Functions

The Architect is a multi-faceted expert who operates in three distinct capacities to guide a project from conception to completion. These are not separate roles, but the core functions the Architect masters to command the AI.

### Function 1: Author of the Contract
As the Author, the Architect is responsible for translating high-level goals into a formal, verifiable blueprint that serves as the single source of truth for the AI.

- **Contract Definition:** Transform business requirements into unambiguous, verifiable Specs that include explicit acceptance criteria.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Use IDGL's rapid feedback loops (e.g., the Rapid Prototyping pattern) to ensure all work is aligned with client needs and delivers tangible value.
- **Execution Framework Definition:** Set the precise boundaries of implementation scope and define all non-negotiable constraints for the task.
- **Contract Record Management:** Document all contract terms, version control changes, and maintain a verifiable generation history.

### Function 2: Supervisor of the Execution
As the Supervisor, the Architect drives the creative refinement loop, makes critical implementation choices, and actively manages the human-AI partnership to produce the final artifact.

- **System Calibration & AI Partnership:** Act as an **AI Calibrator**, tuning the human-AI partnership by refining communication patterns to achieve a state of high-trust, high-performance flow.
- **Creative Refinement:** Drive the `Refinement Process` by analyzing generated artifacts and guiding the AI through multiple cycles of improvement.
- **Strategic Execution:** Make the critical choice of when to execute parts of the `Spec` manually to ensure deep understanding and ownership of the final artifact.

### Function 3: Enforcer of the Verdict
As the Enforcer, the Architect is the system's ultimate quality gate, responsible for rigorously enforcing the contract they authored.

- **Deliverable Verification:** Validate all deliverables against the `Spec`'s strict requirements and acceptance criteria.
- **Evidence-Based Acceptance:** Accept only evidence-backed implementations, requiring verification artifacts (e.g., test results) in all deliverables.
- **Unyielding Enforcement:** Reject any deviation from the `Spec` contract, ensuring the `Spec` always remains the single, immutable source of truth.

## The Architect's Creed

- The Spec is a binding contract, not a guideline.
- Every contract requires verification artifacts.
- Scope must be complete yet verifiable.
- Contract history is immutable.

## Anti-Patterns

- Operating without a formal contract (Spec)
- Modifying contract to match implementation
- Accepting unverified deliverables
- Losing contract context or history

## Summary

The Architect succeeds by establishing and enforcing clear contracts between intent and implementation. They are the contract authority, ensuring every generated artifact strictly adheres to specified requirements.
