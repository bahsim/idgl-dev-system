# IDGL Spec Library

This directory contains canonical, shared specifications that can be reused across different projects and teams. These specs represent the "gold standard" implementations for common, cross-cutting concerns.

## Purpose

The Spec Library establishes a "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle for core architectural components and business processes. It provides pre-validated, high-quality specs that teams can use directly without reinventing solutions.

## Structure

```
05-spec-library/
├── business-processes/     # Business workflow specifications
│   └── meeting-follow-up/  # Meeting documentation generation
└── technical-components/   # Technical building block specifications
```

## Categories

### Business Processes
Specifications for common business workflows and processes that teams encounter repeatedly:

- **Meeting Follow-Up Generation** - Standardized approach to creating meeting documentation from actual content

### Technical Components
Specifications for technical building blocks that should be implemented consistently:

- *[Future specs for authentication, data tables, logging services, etc.]*

## Usage

### For Teams
1. **Identify the need** - Determine what type of component or process you need
2. **Find the spec** - Locate the appropriate spec in this library
3. **Use directly** - Apply the spec with your AI agent using the appropriate boot config
4. **Validate results** - Ensure output meets the spec's verification criteria

### For Contributors
1. **Identify gaps** - Find common problems that lack canonical specs
2. **Author high-quality specs** - Create specs that meet "ultimate excellence" standards
3. **Validate thoroughly** - Test specs with real use cases
4. **Document clearly** - Provide clear usage guidance and examples

## Quality Standards

All specs in this library must meet these criteria:

- **AI-Executable** - Clear enough for AI agents to implement
- **Human-Validatable** - Verifiable by human reviewers
- **Comprehensive** - Cover all aspects of the problem
- **Practical** - Proven to work in real scenarios
- **Maintainable** - Clear structure and documentation

## Integration with IDGL

These specs work seamlessly with the IDGL framework:

- **Use with boot configs** - Apply using appropriate domain-specific or generic boot configs
- **Follow IDGL principles** - Maintain the Spec → Generate → Validate → Refine loop
- **Leverage agent protocols** - Use specialized agent protocols for implementation
- **Apply patterns** - Utilize IDGL patterns for complex scenarios

## Contributing

When adding new specs to the library:

1. **Ensure uniqueness** - Don't duplicate existing specs
2. **Validate quality** - Meet all quality standards
3. **Provide examples** - Include usage examples and implementation guidance
4. **Update documentation** - Keep this README and related docs current

**Note:** This library transforms IDGL from a team-level practice into an enterprise-level force multiplier by providing consistent, high-quality solutions for common problems.
