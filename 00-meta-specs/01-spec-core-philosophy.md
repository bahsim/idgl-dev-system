# Component Spec: Core Philosophy

## 1. Objective
To define the foundational principles, core concepts, and mindset of the Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL). This component answers the question, "Why does IDGL exist, and what is the belief system of the Architect?"

## 2. Rationale
Before a user can learn the "how" of IDGL (the patterns and workflows), they must first understand the "why." A shift to an AI-native development model is primarily a paradigm shift, not a tooling change.

This component serves as the philosophical bedrock for the entire system. It establishes the core dichotomies (Architect vs. Gambler), defines the new development loop, and outlines the creed and responsibilities of the Architect. It also provides answers to common questions about how traditional roles fit into this new paradigm, making the system accessible and understandable.

## 3. Verification Criteria
This component is considered complete and correct if it consists of the following four artifacts, each fulfilling its specified role:

1.  **`00-core.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** To introduce the central thesis of IDGL: the shift from "Coder to Architect."
    *   **Must contain:** The definition of the "Coder vs. Architect" roles and a visual comparison of the "Old Loop" (debugging code) vs. the "New Loop" (refining intent).

2.  **`00-idgl-philosophy.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** To detail the belief system and rules of engagement for the Architect.
    *   **Must contain:** The "Architect's Creed" (foundational laws), the "Core Tenets" (rules of the game), and the "Gambler's Traps" (anti-patterns).

3.  **`06-the-architect-profile.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a formal definition of the Architect's role and responsibilities.
    *   **Must contain:** A clear breakdown of the "Three Core Functions" (Author, Supervisor, Enforcer) and their associated responsibilities.

4.  **`07-faq.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** To address common questions about how traditional roles (BA, Designer, PM, etc.) are integrated into the IDGL framework.
    *   **Must contain:** Specific sections clarifying the function and value of traditional roles within the new paradigm.
