# AI Operational Tooling

This directory contains the tools and generated artifacts for operationalizing the IDGL with an AI agent.

## `idgl-boot-config.yaml`

The core artifact is the **`dist/idgl-boot-config.yaml`** file. This is a machine-readable configuration file that bundles the entire IDGL framework—philosophy, protocols, and communication plays—into a single, structured document.

It is designed to be the "boot prompt" you provide to a large language model (LLM) at the beginning of a session to instantly imbue it with the identity, knowledge, and skills of an IDGL-native AI partner.

## How to Use

### 1. Generate the Boot Configuration

The YAML file is generated by a script. To build or rebuild it, navigate to the `scripts` directory and run the build command:

```bash
cd idgl-dev-system/04-ai-operational/scripts
npm install
npm run build
```

This will create or update the `dist/idgl-boot-config.yaml` file.

### 2. Initialize the AI Agent

At the start of a new chat session with your chosen LLM:

1.  Open the `dist/idgl-boot-config.yaml` file.
2.  Copy the **entire contents** of the file.
3.  Paste the contents into the first prompt you send to the AI.

The AI is now configured. You can begin interacting with it using the roles and plays defined in the configuration. For example, your next prompt could be:

> "Act as a Code Analyst. Please provide a report on the public API of this file: `src/components/MyComponent.ts`"

By providing this configuration, you have transformed a general-purpose AI into a specialized, expert partner for your IDGL workflow.
