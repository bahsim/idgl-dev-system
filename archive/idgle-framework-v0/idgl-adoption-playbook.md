# IDGL Adoption Playbook

A practical, actionable guide for introducing the Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL) methodology into real teams and organizations. This playbook is designed for Delivery Managers, team leads, and anyone seeking to pilot and scale IDGL in practice.

---

## 1. Introduction

**What is IDGL?**  
IDGL (Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle) is a methodology that shifts software development from task-based, tool-centric work to outcome-driven, AI-empowered collaboration. It enables teams to clarify intent, accelerate delivery, and raise quality across the board.

**Why a new approach?**  
Traditional methods focus on solving many small problems. IDGL enables a paradigm shift: teams work at a higher level, with less rework, clearer requirements, and more business value delivered.

## 2. Delivery Manager’s Perspective

**What do Delivery Managers care about?**
- Predictable, on-time delivery
- Reduced risk and fewer blockers
- Measurable improvement in team output
- Team morale and satisfaction

**How to engage them:**
- Show before/after metrics (e.g., time to PoC, rework reduction)
- Highlight quick wins and reduced firefighting
- Use checklists:
  - [ ] Will this approach unblock teams faster?
  - [ ] Will it reduce rework and clarify requirements?
  - [ ] Is there a clear way to measure improvement?

## 3. The Need for Real Success Cases

**Why theory isn’t enough:**
- Delivery Managers and teams need to see practical, measurable results—not just promises.

**What a good case looks like:**
- The team defines and owns the intent
- All roles (BA, dev, QA) see tangible benefits
- Example: “After adopting IDGL, our team reduced requirement clarification cycles from 3 days to 1, and delivered the first PoC in 2 days instead of 7.”

---

## 4. What a Good Case Demonstrates

**Role-by-role benefits:**
- **BA:** Uses AI to clarify requirements, saves time, reinvests in better docs
- **Dev:** Delivers code faster, with fewer misunderstandings
- **QA:** Gets clearer test cases, less ambiguity
- **Team:** Rapid PoC unblocks work, paradigm shift in quality and satisfaction

**Template:**
```
Role: [BA/Dev/QA/Other]
Old way: [Describe previous pain point]
With IDGL: [Describe new approach]
Result: [Measurable improvement]
```

## 5. How to Start: Selecting and Running a Pilot

**Project/team selection criteria:**
- Small, motivated team
- Real pain point (e.g., requirements churn, slow delivery)
- Openness to experiment

**Team readiness checklist:**
- [ ] Team is open to new approaches
- [ ] There’s a clear business need
- [ ] Leadership supports a pilot
- [ ] Willingness to document and share results

---

## 6. Your Role as Facilitator

**How to enable, not do:**
- Facilitate intent definition
- Guide use of AI tools
- Let the team deliver and own results

**Coaching template:**
> “As a facilitator, my job is to help you define your intent, set up the process, and support you as you learn. You own the delivery and the results.”

---

## 7. Step-by-Step Pilot Guide

**Preparation:**
- Train team on IDGL basics and AI tools
- Set up shared documentation (intent doc, backlog, etc.)
- Draft first intent statement

**Execution:**
- Run short, focused cycles (Intent → AI Generation → Validation)
- Use AI for docs, code, and tests
- Hold regular check-ins and retrospectives

**Review:**
- Measure outcomes (see metrics below)
- Gather feedback from all roles
- Document lessons learned

**Scaling:**
- Share results with other teams
- Refine process based on feedback
- Expand to new projects

---

## 8. Measuring Success

**Pilot success metrics:**
- Time to first PoC
- Number of requirement clarifications
- Reduction in rework
- Team satisfaction (survey)
- Code quality (defect rate, test coverage)

---

## 9. Overcoming Obstacles

**Common objections and responses:**
- “We don’t have time for this.”
  - Try on a small feature; if it doesn’t save time, stop.
- “AI can’t understand our business.”
  - AI helps clarify, but you remain in control. It’s a co-pilot, not a replacement.
- “What if it fails?”
  - Measure and review after a short pilot. No risk to main delivery.

## 10. Templates and Tools

**Intent Statement Template:**
```
Intent: [What outcome do we want?]
Success Criteria: [How will we know we’ve succeeded?]
Constraints: [What must we consider?]
Stakeholders: [Who is involved?]
```

**Kickoff Agenda:**
- Introduce IDGL
- Define pilot goals
- Draft first intent
- Assign roles
- Set check-in cadence

**Roles & Responsibilities Table:**
| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| BA   | Clarify requirements, document intent |
| Dev  | Implement features, use AI tools |
| QA   | Define test cases, validate outcomes |
| Lead | Facilitate process, remove blockers |

---

## 11. Real-World Scenarios: “Day in the Life”

**BA:**
- Old way: Spends hours clarifying requirements, lots of back-and-forth
- With IDGL: Uses AI to draft, clarify, and document requirements; spends saved time on edge cases and quality

**Developer:**
- Old way: Waits for clarifications, reworks code after misunderstandings
- With IDGL: Gets clear intent, uses AI to generate code/tests, delivers faster

**QA:**
- Old way: Ambiguous test cases, late discovery of requirement gaps
- With IDGL: Participates in intent definition, uses AI to generate and refine test cases

**Delivery Manager:**
- Old way: Constantly unblocking teams, firefighting
- With IDGL: Monitors clear metrics, sees fewer blockers, focuses on value delivery

## 12. Summary Statement for Stakeholders

> “We’re not just adding more tools or solving isolated problems. We’re piloting a new way of working—where teams use AI to clarify intent, accelerate delivery, and raise quality across the board. Our goal is to prove this with a real project, owned by the team, and then share the results.”
