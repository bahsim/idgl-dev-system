### Foundational Concepts

**IDGL (Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle)** - A software development methodology that leverages strategic human-AI collaboration, focusing on outcome-driven intentions rather than traditional task-based workflows, compliant with ISO/IEC 12207:2008 process standards.

**Intent** - A precise, measurable declaration of desired outcomes that articulates what needs to be accomplished, not what needs to be built. Structured as: "Build [capability] that delivers [specific outcome] for [user segment]", following ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 requirements engineering principles.

**Generative Cycle** - A continuous iteration loop comprising three core phases: intent definition, AI-powered solution generation, and human validation with refinement, aligned with ISO/IEC 12207:2008 process lifecycle.

**AI-Native Workflow** - A development methodology purpose-built for human-AI collaboration, rather than retrofitting existing processes, incorporating ISO/IEC 25010:2011 quality model considerations.

### Team Roles (ISO/IEC 12207:2008 Alignment)

**Strategic Lead** - The human counterpart responsible for crafting intentions, providing strategic guidance, and validating AI-generated outputs. Typically a Product Manager, Technical Lead, or Senior Engineer, fulfilling ISO/IEC 12207:2008 stakeholder roles.
