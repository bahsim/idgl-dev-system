# The Rapid Prototyping Play

## 1. The Play
The highest risk in any project is miscommunication. Traditional development tries to solve this with weeks of meetings and documents, leading to long feedback cycles and a high risk of building the wrong thing.

The **Rapid Prototyping Play** is the Architect's strategy for crushing this risk. It leverages the IDGL's core strength—the cheap and fast generation of artifacts—to transform a high-risk, talk-based process into a low-risk, evidence-based one.

## 2. When to Run This Play
This play is run in the early stages of a project or feature, when the requirements are uncertain and there is a significant risk of stakeholder misalignment. The goal is to bridge the gap between abstract conversation and concrete reality as quickly as possible.

## 3. How to Run the Play
The workflow is a simple, client-centric loop:

1.  **Author a Lean `Spec`:** Instead of a comprehensive, detailed `Spec`, the Architect authors a *lean* `Spec` that captures only the partial requirements and the core uncertainties.
2.  **Generate Multiple Variants:** The Architect then uses this lean `Spec` to generate several *partially-working variants*. Each variant explores a different potential direction or interpretation of the requirements.
3.  **Present Concrete Choices:** In a single, short meeting, these tangible prototypes are presented to the client. The conversation is no longer about abstract possibilities; it is a concrete choice between "Option A, Option B, or a mix of both."
4.  **Receive High-Quality Feedback:** The client, now empowered by seeing real, interactive examples, can provide clear, decisive feedback. This feedback is then used to author the official, high-confidence `Spec`.

## 4. The Result
In the span of a few hours, a process that would traditionally take weeks is transformed into a highly productive and collaborative workshop.

*   **A week of meetings becomes a one-hour decision.**
*   **The risk of building the wrong thing is almost entirely eliminated.**
*   **The client feels empowered and happy**, having been made a true partner in the creative process.
