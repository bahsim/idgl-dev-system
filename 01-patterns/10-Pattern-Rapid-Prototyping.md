# Pattern: Rapid Prototyping for Client Feedback

#### 1. Context

You are in the early stages of a project or feature. The requirements are uncertain, and there is a significant risk of miscommunication between the development team and the client or stakeholders. Traditional development would require weeks of meetings and documentation to solidify requirements before any tangible artifact can be produced, leading to long feedback cycles and a high risk of building the wrong thing.

#### 2. Problem

How can we dramatically shorten the feedback loop and reduce the risk of requirement ambiguity? How can we empower a client to make a clear, confident decision when they are not yet sure what they want?

The core challenge is to bridge the gap between abstract conversation and concrete reality.

#### 3. Solution: The Client-Centric Generation Loop

Employ the **Rapid Prototyping Pattern**. This pattern leverages the IDGL's core strength—the cheap and fast generation of artifacts—to transform a high-risk, talk-based process into a low-risk, evidence-based one.

The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Author a Lean `Spec`:** Instead of a comprehensive, detailed `Spec`, the practitioner authors a *lean* `Spec` that captures only the partial requirements and the core uncertainties.
2.  **Generate Multiple Variants:** The practitioner then uses this lean `Spec` to generate several *partially-working variants*. Each variant explores a different potential direction or interpretation of the requirements.
3.  **Present Concrete Choices:** In a single, short meeting (e.g., one hour), these tangible prototypes are presented to the client. The conversation is no longer about abstract possibilities; it is a concrete choice between "Option A, Option B, or a mix of both."
4.  **Receive High-Quality Feedback:** The client, now empowered by seeing real, interactive examples, can provide clear, decisive feedback. This feedback is then used to author a new, much more precise `Spec v2.0`.

This pattern is the ultimate expression of **client-centricity**. It respects the client's time and intellectual energy by doing the hard work of turning ambiguity into clarity.

#### 4. The Result

In the span of a few hours, a process that would traditionally take a week or more of meetings and carry a high risk of failure is transformed into a highly productive and collaborative workshop.

*   **A week of meetings becomes a one-hour decision.**
*   **The risk of building the wrong thing is almost entirely eliminated.**
*   **The client feels empowered and happy**, having been made a true partner in the creative process.

This pattern demonstrates that the `New Paradigm Loop` is not just for internal development; it is a powerful tool for communication, discovery, and client alignment.
