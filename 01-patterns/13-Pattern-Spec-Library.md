# The Spec Library Play

## 1. The Play
As an organization scales its use of the IDGL, individual Architects or teams will repeatedly face similar problems (e.g., user authentication, data tables, logging services). Authoring a high-quality `Spec` for these common components from scratch each time is inefficient and leads to inconsistencies.

The **Spec Library Play** establishes a "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle for an organization's core architectural components. It is the practice of creating and maintaining a canonical, version-controlled library of high-quality, pre-validated `Specs` for common, cross-cutting concerns.

## 2. How to Run the Play

This play involves creating a central, shared repository for `Specs`.

1.  **Create a `spec-library` Repository:** Establish a new Git repository to serve as the single source of truth for canonical `Specs`. The structure might look like this:
    ```
    spec-library/
    ├── web-components/
    │   ├── data-table/
    │   │   ├── spec.md
    │   │   └── README.md
    │   └── user-profile-card/
    │       ├── spec.md
    │       └── README.md
    └── services/
        └── authentication/
            ├── spec.md
            └── README.md
    ```

2.  **Identify Canonical Components:** The architectural leadership of the organization identifies components that are fundamental to their technology stack and should be implemented consistently across all projects.

3.  **Author and Validate the Canonical `Spec`:** The most experienced Architects are tasked with authoring the "gold standard" `Spec` for each canonical component. This `Spec` undergoes a rigorous validation and review process before being accepted into the library.

4.  **Consume the `Spec`:** When a development team needs to implement a canonical component, they do not write a new `Spec`. They pull the approved `Spec` from the library and use it as the direct input for their `Code Generator` agent. This ensures that every implementation of a data table or authentication service adheres to the same high standard.

## 3. The Advantage
A `Spec` Library transforms the IDGL from a team-level practice into an enterprise-level force multiplier.

*   **Architectural Consistency:** It guarantees that core components are designed and built the same way across the entire organization, eliminating architectural drift.
*   **Massive Time Savings:** It saves countless hours of re-planning and re-specifying common problems.
*   **Codified Best Practices:** The library becomes the living embodiment of the organization's best practices. The `Spec` for the authentication service *is* the official, executable standard for how to do authentication.
*   **Simplified Onboarding:** New developers can be brought up to speed on the organization's architecture by reading the clear, high-level `Specs` in the library, rather than trying to parse thousands of lines of code.
