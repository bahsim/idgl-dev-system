# The Stealth Architect Play

## 1. The Play
An individual developer wants to adopt the IDGL to improve their personal effectiveness, but they work in a high-pressure environment with tight deadlines, vague requirements, and teammates who are resistant to new processes. A formal, team-wide "Vanguard Project" is not feasible.

The **Stealth Architect Play** is a pragmatic, bottom-up strategy for adopting IDGL principles to achieve personal mastery and organically influence the team through proven results, not persuasion.

## 2. How to Run the Play

This play has five tactical phases. The key is that phases 1-4 are performed privately by the individual developer.

### Phase 1: The Private `Spec`
For any task you receive (a vague Jira ticket, a verbal request), you privately draft a mini-`Spec` for your own use. You don't share it, you just use it to clarify your own thinking. Focus on defining the concrete **Verification Criteria** that will mean the task is "done."

### Phase 2: The "Echo & Refine" Tactic
This is the core tactic for fixing broken communication without confrontation. You use your private `Spec` to manufacture clarity.

*   **Instead of saying:** "This ticket is too vague."
*   **You say:** "This is great. Just to confirm my understanding before I start coding, my plan is to deliver a component that meets these specific criteria: *[You list the Verification Criteria from your private Spec]*. Does that sound right, or am I missing anything?"

You have now created a verbal contract and forced the requester to think in terms of verifiable outcomes, without ever using the term "IDGL" or "Spec."

### Phase 3: The Personal Force Multiplier
Use the **[AI Agent Protocols](../../10-agent-protocols/README.md)** for your own work. Use the `Spec Compiler` to help you formulate the clarifying questions for the "Echo & Refine" tactic. Use the `Code Generator` to flawlessly execute your now-clear `Spec`. This will dramatically increase your personal speed and the quality of your output.

### Phase 4: Let the Artifacts Speak
Your pull requests will become your most powerful tool of influence. They will naturally be different from others:
*   **The PR Description:** Will be exceptionally clear (it's the `Objective` from your private `Spec`).
*   **The Code:** Will be clean, focused, and directly map to the requirements.
*   **The Tests:** Will be comprehensive and meaningful (they map directly to your `Verification Criteria`).

You will close tickets with fewer bugs and less back-and-forth.

### Phase 5: Create an "Effectiveness Gradient"
Your consistent, high-quality output will be noticed. Teammates, managers, and QA will start asking *how* your work is always so well-defined and easy to review. This creates a natural "pull" for your methods. You can now start sharing your "secret" organically, from a position of proven success. You can suggest simple, concrete practices like "I find it helpful to write down a checklist of how I'll test it before I start."

## 3. The Advantage
This play allows any developer to become an Architect and reap the benefits of the IDGL, regardless of their team's culture. It replaces top-down persuasion with bottom-up influence, which is often far more powerful and sustainable in the real world.
