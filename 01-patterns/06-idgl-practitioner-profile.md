# The IDGL Practitioner Profile

## Definition

An **IDGL Practitioner** is a trained professional who leverages the **Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL)** to systematically create and manage artifacts with the assistance of artificial intelligence. They are not merely a "prompter" but a strategist who directs the AI, validates its output, and orchestrates complex tasks.

The practitioner's role is to act as the architect and quality guarantor of the generative process, using the AI as a powerful, tireless, but ultimately subordinate tool.

## Core Competencies and Mindset

An effective IDGL Practitioner possesses a unique blend of technical, strategic, and analytical skills:

### 1. Master of Intent Formulation
The practitioner excels at translating high-level goals into precise, actionable, and context-rich intents that guide the AI. They understand that the quality of the output is directly proportional to the quality of the intent provided.

### 2. Strategic Orchestrator
They view complex problems through the lens of **Generative Task Orchestration**. They know when to give the AI a large, comprehensive task and, in exceptional cases, when to decompose a monumental goal into more manageable (yet still significant) sub-tasks.

### 3. Rigorous Validator
The practitioner does not blindly trust AI-generated output. They are a critical and diligent validator, systematically checking the artifact against the intent, business rules, and quality standards. They are responsible for the final quality of the work.

### 4. Methodical Historian
They understand the importance of a clean and logical history. They judiciously decide when to **refine** an existing `Generation Record` to perfect a strategy, and when to **create a new record** to explore a different strategic path, adhering to the two-loop model of the IDGL.

### 5. Legacy Modernizer
For existing projects, the practitioner can execute the **Legacy Artifact Onboarding** process, reverse-engineering the implicit intent of old code and bootstrapping it into the IDGL framework for future development.

## Summary
The IDGL Practitioner is not defined by their ability to write code but by their ability to direct the creation of code (or any artifact). They are a high-level thinker who operates the generative machinery with precision, discipline, and a clear vision of the end goal.
