# The Directory Structure Play

## 1. The Play
An Architect's work must be organized and traceable. The **Directory Structure** play is the strategy for organizing an IDGL project to ensure clarity and a clean separation between the process and the product.

This play defines a standard file system layout for organizing `Specs`, `Artifacts`, and their related documentation in a dedicated `.idgl/` directory at the project's root.

## 2. The Project-Level Structure
The `.idgl` directory is organized to reflect the two primary modes of the project lifecycle: formal **Development Phases** for major epics, and a `sustaining/` directory for ongoing, incremental work.

```
.idgl/
│
├── 📁 01-scaffolding-phase/
├── 📁 02-authentication-phase/
├── 📁 03-product-catalog-phase/  // <-- A new phase for a major new epic
│
└── 📁 sustaining/
    │
    └── 📁 authentication/                 // The feature-specific context
        │
        ├── 📁 fix-recent-login-bug/      // <-- New, active tasks live here
        ├── 📁 add-new-tooltip/
        │
        └── 📁 archive/                  // <-- Old, completed tasks are moved here
            │
            ├── 📁 2024/
            └── 📁 2023/
```

### Development Phases
Major new feature sets are registered as a new, numbered **Development Phase** folder. This creates a clean, chronological history of the project's major milestones.

#### The Anatomy of a Phase
A Development Phase is not just a folder; it is a formal, multi-step process for executing a large-scale epic. It follows a consistent five-step flow:

1.  **Define Main Goal:** The Architect defines the focused objective for the phase in a top-level `Spec`.
2.  **Design the System:** A generative task is used to create the architectural blueprint.
3.  **Create Comprehensive Plan:** The Architect uses the **[Decomposition Play](./03-Pattern-Decomposition.md)** to break the blueprint down into a dependency graph of smaller tasks.
4.  **Execute the Plan:** The Architect (or their team) works through the generated tasks.
5.  **Deliver Final Result:** The validated output of the phase is integrated into the main codebase.

### Sustaining Work
Smaller, ad-hoc tasks (like bug fixes or minor features) are registered inside the top-level `sustaining/` directory, which is organized by feature. This directory uses a simple "active vs. archive" model to keep the workspace clean. New tasks are created at the root of a feature folder, and a periodic process moves completed tasks into the `archive/`.

## 3. The Anatomy of a Single Task
Every folder within a Phase or the `sustaining/` directory represents a single, complete generative task.

### Simple Task (The Common Case)
Most tasks are simple and do not require further breakdown.

```
[name-of-generative-task]/
├── 📄 intent.md
├── 📄 validation_summary.md
├── 📁 artifact/
└── 📁 records/
```
*   **`intent.md`**: The `Spec` for this task.
*   **`validation_summary.md`**: The final outcome (pass/fail) of the task.
*   **`artifact/`**: The final, validated code or output.
*   **`records/`**: The **[Generation Records](./06-Pattern-Generation-Record.md)** logging the strategic decisions.

### Complex Task (Using the Decomposition Play)
For a complex task, a `decomposition/` folder is added, which contains the sub-tasks generated by the **[Decomposition Play](./03-Pattern-Decomposition.md)**. Each sub-task is itself a complete generative task.

```
[name-of-generative-task]/
├── 📄 intent.md
└── 📁 decomposition/
    ├── 📁 01-create-database-schema/
    │   ├── 📄 intent.md
    │   └── ... (a complete generative task)
    │
    └── 📁 02-seed-data/
        └── ... (a complete generative task)
```
