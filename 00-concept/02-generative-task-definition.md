# Generative Task

## Definition

A **Generative Task** is any activity or process whose primary objective is to create a new artifact that did not previously exist. These artifacts can be diverse in nature, including but not limited to:

*   **Code:** Software components, scripts, functions, or entire applications.
*   **Text:** Documentation, user stories, specifications, articles, or marketing copy.
*   **Images:** Illustrations, diagrams, user interface mockups, or photos.
*   **Data:** Synthetic datasets for testing, structured information, or reports.
*   **Configuration:** Infrastructure as Code files, project configurations, or deployment manifests.

In the context of the **Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL)**, a generative task is the specific unit of work that is addressed within an "ai-gen" cycle. The process begins with an intent to complete a generative task, and the cycle of AI generation, validation, and refinement is applied until the resulting artifact successfully fulfills that intent.

For example, within the broader domain of software development, activities such as "writing a unit test for the authentication service," "creating a user profile component," or "drafting API documentation" are all considered distinct generative tasks.
