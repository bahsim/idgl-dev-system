# Artifact

## Definition

In the context of the **Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL)**, an **Artifact** is the tangible output produced during the **AI Generation** stage. It is the concrete item that is created to fulfill a specific **Intent**.

The artifact is the central element of the "ai-gen" cycle. It is:

1.  **Generated** by the AI based on the initial intent.
2.  **Validated** against the requirements of that intent.
3.  **Refined** through iterative cycles until it aligns perfectly with the desired outcome.

An artifact can be any form of generated content, such as:

*   A block of source code.
*   A user story or technical documentation.
*   A diagram or user interface mockup.
*   A configuration file.
*   A set of test data.

Essentially, if a **Generative Task** is the "verb" (the action of creating), the **Artifact** is the "noun" (the thing that is created).
