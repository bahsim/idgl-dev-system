# The Communication Principles

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the foundational principles for all human-AI interaction within the IDGL system. These are not optional patterns; they are the core, essential skills required of a practitioner. Mastering these principles is a prerequisite for authoring a high-quality `Spec` and for successfully executing the `Artifact Lifecycle`.

## 2. Core Principles of Communication

| # | Rule | Purpose | Analogy | Benefit / Harm |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Formulate the Goal Explicitly** | To direct the AI's attention to a specific result. | A surgeon's precise incision, targeting only what needs to be removed. | **Benefit:** Focus, less fluff. <br/> **Harm:** Generation of "emptiness" without a goal. |
| 2 | **Specify the Output Format** | To simplify perception and verification of the result. | An architect provides a blueprint, not a verbal description of a house. | **Benefit:** Convenient to compare and use. <br/> **Harm:** A chaotic mess of output. |
| 3 | **Establish the AI's Role** | To set the model to the desired position (e.g., expert, poet). | A director casting the right actor for a role, ensuring the performance matches the script's intent. | **Benefit:** Consistency with the task's tone. <br/> **Harm:** An unclear style without a role. |
| 4 | **Limit and Clarify Conditions** | To significantly reduce vagueness and errors. | A lawyer drafting a contract, where clear clauses prevent loopholes and ambiguity. | **Benefit:** High accuracy. <br/> **Harm:** Chaotic output without a framework. |
| 5 | **Iterate** | To achieve perfection through refinement and dialogue. | A sculptor shaping clay, where each pass refines the form and brings the final vision closer. | **Benefit:** Collaborative idea development. <br/> **Harm:** Boilerplate output without iteration. |
| 6 | **Request Feedback** | To check for understanding and tune the collaboration. | A pilot's readback to air traffic control, confirming a shared understanding before taking action. | **Benefit:** Consistency. <br/> **Harm:** Misunderstanding without feedback. |
| 7 | **Use Universal Concepts** | To simplify the AI's translation of abstract requirements. | The Rosetta Stone, which uses a common, understood language as a key to unlock a new one. | **Benefit:** Expands thinking. <br/> **Harm:** Incomprehensible if concepts are too unique. |
| 8 | **Develop Discipline of Thought** | To make the prompt clear, strong, and unambiguous. | A Military Field Manual, where clarity and discipline are instruments of survival and success. | **Benefit:** Forms the intellect. <br/> **Harm:** Verbal noise without discipline. |

## 3. The Mindset of the New Generation AI Operator

A new generation AI operator must master a **basic logical-structural culture**: the ability to formulate a goal, break a task into its constituent parts, and understand the core categories of data, actions, context, and constraints. This is akin to 'technical literacy' in a humanitarian form: the skill of engaging in a dialogue with a machine as an equal partner in thinking.

The operator must understand the principles of feedback, and be able to read and double-check the AI's output, not just blindly trust it. This requires the development of **critical thinking** and the basics of semiotics: how meanings are turned into signs, and how signs transform meaning. This requires interdisciplinary maturity, because the role of the AI is a reflection of the operator's own thought process.

Finally, the operator must **respect the energy of attention**â€”both their own and the model's. They must not overload or obscure their requests. They must learn restraint, clarity, and conciseness. It is from this discipline that true collaboration is born, where intelligence is not a machine and not a human, but a link in a new language.
