# AI Agent Protocols

This directory contains the source-of-truth markdown files that define the roles, responsibilities, and rules of engagement for an IDGL-native AI agent.

These files are not meant to be used directly. They are the raw material consumed by the **boot configuration bundler**.

For instructions on how to build and use the `idgl-boot-config.yaml` to initialize an AI agent, please see the guide in the operational tooling directory:
