Provide guidance on how a team can implement the ADGL framework using existing tools and platforms.

* **Agentic Platforms**: Mention that the ADGL can be implemented using platforms that support multi-agent collaboration, tool use, and long-term memory.
* **Tool Integration**: Explain how to integrate agents with essential development tools like **version control systems (Git)**, **integrated development environments (IDEs)**, **testing frameworks**, and **deployment pipelines**.
* **Development Environment**: Describe a recommended development environment that facilitates agent interaction, such as a sandbox environment where agents can safely execute code and run tests without affecting the production system.
