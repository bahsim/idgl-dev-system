### Roles and Responsibilities
Clarify the specific roles and responsibilities of both the human and the various agents. This goes beyond the high-level description and defines what each party is accountable for.

* **Human Developer/Strategist**: Detail their role in providing and refining the **Intent Specification**, approving the **Decomposition Plan**, managing project-level resources and tools, and performing the final, critical validation.
* **The Super-Agent**: Explain its specific responsibilities for orchestration, communication, and risk management. This agent acts as a project manager, ensuring that sub-tasks are executed correctly and that the overall project stays on track.
* **Specialized Sub-Agents**: Provide examples of specialized agents that might be part of an ADGL framework (e.g., a **"Test Agent"** to create and run tests, a **"Documentation Agent"** to write READMEs and API docs, and a **"Refactoring Agent"** to handle code quality).
