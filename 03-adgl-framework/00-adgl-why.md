### ADGL: The Core Idea

The main idea behind ADGL is to move beyond simple "prompt engineering" and to a more structured way of managing AI agents. Instead of telling the AI every single step, you give it a high-level goal and let it figure out the details. The framework defines the rules of this collaboration:

* **You (the human) are the strategist.** You set the high-level intent, like "Build a user login system." You don't write the code, but you're in charge of the project's direction and success.
* **The AI agent is the executor.** It takes your intent, creates its own plan to achieve it, writes the code, and even runs tests.
* **The system is based on contracts.** The human and the AI communicate using clear, machine-readable contracts like API specifications or data schemas. This keeps communication clear and prevents misinterpretation.
* **Validation is the key.** The human's most important job is to review and approve the agent's plan and final code. This prevents the agent from going off-track or generating errors.

The principles of ADGL are already being practiced by advanced developers and are built into new AI tools. Many platforms now offer features like:

* **Agentic Planning:** A feature where the AI models out a series of steps to achieve a goal.
* **Tool Use:** The AI is given access to a suite of tools (like a code interpreter or web browser) to complete its tasks.
* **Self-Correction:** The AI can recognize when its code fails a test and then debug and fix the problem on its own.

ADGL is simply a way to formalize these emerging best practices into a coherent framework. It's a way to describe how the best teams are already starting to work. It helps you manage the risks of using autonomous agents, like hallucination, by making human oversight a core part of the process.
