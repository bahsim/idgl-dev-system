### Guardrails and Best Practices
Outline the best practices and guardrails to ensure the ADGL is used effectively and safely.

* **Human Validation Gates**: Clearly define when and where a human must intervene for validation. This prevents a runaway agent and ensures quality.
* **Agent-Human Communication Protocol**: Establish a protocol for how agents communicate with humans, including how they report progress, ask for clarification, or raise red flags.
* **Risk Management**: Detail how the ADGL framework can be used to mitigate risks like agent hallucination, security vulnerabilities in generated code, and the misinterpretation of intent.
