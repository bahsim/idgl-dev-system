# The IDGL Practitioner Profile

## Definition

An **IDGL Practitioner** establishes and enforces contracts between human intent and artificial intelligence through the Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle. Unlike traditional roles that interact with AI as an assistant, the IDGL Practitioner maintains the **Spec** as a binding contract that AI must fulfill.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Contract Definition**
   - Transform business requirements into formal, verifiable Specs
   - Ensure Specs are complete and unambiguous
   - Define explicit acceptance criteria for verification

2. **Stakeholder Alignment and Value Delivery**
   - Use IDGL's rapid feedback loops (e.g., the Rapid Prototyping pattern) to ensure all work is aligned with client needs.
   - Focus the generative process on delivering tangible, client-centric value.
   - Make the client an empowered, active participant in the design and validation process.

3. **Execution Framework**
   - Set precise boundaries of implementation scope
   - Define non-negotiable constraints
   - Require verification artifacts in deliverables

4. **Contract Enforcement**
   - Validate deliverables against Spec requirements
   - Accept only evidence-backed implementations
   - Reject any deviation from Spec contract

5. **Contract Record**
   - Document all contract terms and decisions
   - Version control contract changes
   - Maintain verifiable generation history

6. **System Calibration**
   - Act as an **AI Calibrator**, tuning the human-AI partnership itself.
   - Refine and adapt communication patterns to achieve a state of high-trust, high-performance flow.
   - Understand the nuances of the AI agent as a sensitive system, providing the right context and persona to elicit the highest quality response.

## Key Principles

- Spec is a binding contract, not a guideline
- Every contract requires verification artifacts
- Scope must be complete yet verifiable
- Contract history is immutable

## Anti-Patterns

- Operating without a formal contract (Spec)
- Modifying contract to match implementation
- Accepting unverified deliverables
- Losing contract context or history

## Summary

The IDGL Practitioner succeeds by establishing and enforcing clear contracts between intent and implementation. They are the contract authority, ensuring every generated artifact strictly adheres to specified requirements.
