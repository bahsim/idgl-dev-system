# How to Begin Your Journey

The right first step depends on who "we" are. The IDGL provides a clear, pragmatic path for every situation.

### Path 1: The Individual Developer
*Your goal is to learn the core workflow.*

Your first step is **not** to read all the philosophy documents. It is to get your hands dirty immediately.

### Path 2: The Team Lead
*Your goal is to introduce this methodology to your team with minimal disruption.*

Your first step is **not** to schedule a training course. It is to prove the value on a real project.

### Path 3: The Developer in a High-Pressure Environment
*Your goal is to increase your personal effectiveness, even if your team is resistant to change.*

Your first step is **not** to persuade your teammates. It is to use the IDGL privately to make yourself so effective that your results speak for themselves. This is a bottom-up strategy of influence through excellence.

### The Next Level: Commanding the AI with Protocols

Once you have chosen your path and are ready to move beyond the basics, the next step is to master the **AI Agent Protocol Library**. This is how you unlock the full power of the IDGL.

These protocols are configuration files that turn a general-purpose AI into a specialized professional for a specific task. Learning to use them is the final step in moving from being a student of the IDGL to a practicing Architect.
